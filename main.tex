\title{Extending the CompCert Interpreter to Execute Compiled Libraries Using Operational Semantics for Assembly}

\author{Alastair White}

\abstract{
Improving detection of undefined behaviour in programs is an ongoing effort in both the cybersecurity and programming languages community. This project contributes to the existing effort by extending an interpreter that uses formal semantics of the C language to define the execution of a program. The extension improves the interpreter by adding the ability to call external functions in compiled object files.

To implement this contribution, the project takes a series of steps to run the external functions. Compiled object files are first disassembled into their corresponding \lstinline{x86_64} representation before being formatted and passed into the interpreter. The instructions are then executed when called upon by an assembly interpreter on the same memory model as the interpreter. The assembly interpreter is derived from definitions of the operational semantics of \lstinline{x86_64} program execution and calls on instruction execution defined by formal semantics. 

Previous work in this area\cite{linking-rigorous} took the approach of running executable shared object files in a separate process and integrating the returned values and in-memory objects. The previous work has the drawback that any undefined behaviour present in the external executable will be undetected and introduce a security vulnerability. 

The project was a success and the interpreter is able to call a wide variety of external functions. Since the resultant system is based on the operational semantics of instruction execution any instructions that violate defined behaviour in C will be detected. As a side effect the assembly interpreter acts as a dynamic binary analysis tool for free ensuring program correctness.


% CompCert is a formally verified optimizing compiler that supports a subset of C11. The CompCert compiler includes an interpreter for C that executes C code on the same formal semantics that the compiler is written on and can detect undefined behaviour in programs. The current interpreter is limited by it's inability to call external functions. The aim of this project is to extend the interpreter such that it can dynamically load and call external functions in compiled object files so that the interpreter can execute code that relies on external libraries.
